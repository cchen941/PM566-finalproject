### Brief Description of this Project:
As we know, most people infected with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill or die at any age. The data set of this project is from CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and talks about provisional COVID-19 deaths in the United States by date, state, sex, and age groups.

The objective of this project is to explore the answer to the following questions: 

Do COVID-19 death cases decrease by date?

Do COVID-19 death cases vary by state, sex,  and age group?
