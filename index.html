<h2>Brief Description</h2>
<p>As we know, most people infected with COVID-19 will experience mild
to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
treatment. However, some will become seriously ill or die at any age.
The data set of this project is from CDC (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention) and talks about provisional COVID-19 deaths in United
States by date, state, sex and age groups.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to explore the answer to questions
below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the number of COVID-19 deaths change by date?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the COVID-19 death cases change over date in different
states?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the number of COVID-19 deaths vary by sex and age?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first chart is the line graph of COVID-19 deaths by dates
throughout 3 years. It can be clearly seen from the figure that death
cases increased in 2020-2021, and began to decrease after 2021. For each
year, the change in death cases is cyclical, with the highest point
appearing in January 2021.</p>
<p>The second chart focuses on the 2020-2021 year, with more death cases
in this stage and we can also take a closer look at the distribution by
different states. It is shown that by July 2020, the peak of death cases
mainly occurred near New York State. However, by entering 2021, the
death cases in California began to increase rapidly and reached the
highest peak. After July 2021, Florida became the state with the largest
number of deaths although the overall number of deaths cases
decline.</p>

<p>The first chart shows the histogram distributions for death cases
under 1000. It shows that most of the counts are under 250 cases. I
differentiate gender in each histogram by color, but from the graph, I
can’t find an apparent regulation that the number of death cases is
related to gender.</p>

<p>The second figure is the bar chart of death cases by age group, also
colored by sex. It can be seen from this figure that the number of death
cases shows an apparent increasing trend with the increasing age. In
most age groups (except those over 85 years old), the number of deaths
of male is more than that of female.</p>
